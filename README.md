# iMood Privacy Policy

This privacy policy explains how we collect, use and share data through our products and services (including our websites and mobile applications) and we refer to these together as the “Apps”.

iMood is the controller of your personal data, and iMood is committed to personal data protection. We provide you with this Privacy Policy to make our users aware of the steps we take to ensure the security of their data when utilizing the Apps. This policy describes the types of information we collect when you use the Apps, how we use and protect that information, how long we retain it, and with whom we share it. It also explains what your rights and options are as they pertain to privacy.  By using the Apps, you consent to our collection and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.

# Your personal data.

*iCloud*. Some Apps may offer you the opportunity to store your data in your iCloud. Your iCloud account is with Apple, not with iMood. When you turn on iCloud Sync on your device, the App will copy your app device data to your private iCloud account. The App will keep the data on your device and the iCloud container in sync. iCloud Sync also allows you to have the app data in sync between several devices that use the same iCloud account. Information stored in iCloud is treated in accordance with the Apple Privacy Policy (please visit [Apple Customer Privacy Policy](http://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/) for more details).

# Sharing your Personal Data.

*Apple*: Our Apps may offer you the opportunity to store your data in your iCloud. Further, unless you do opt-out from Apple’s standard “Diagnostics & Usage” policy, your device will automatically send crash data whenever an App crashes on iOS, and we will also have access to your crash reports.

We let you know about any material changes to our Privacy Policy. If we decide to make material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will tell you on our website.

Please also periodically check back for updates!
